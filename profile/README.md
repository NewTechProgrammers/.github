About Us
New Tech Kraken is a newly formed high school FIRST Robotic Competition (FRC) team, operating under the New Technology College. We believe that FRC is a powerful program that can challenge and grow the high school students in our region, and have a positive impact on our community. We're a community based team based out of Lesser Poland Voivodeship, serving the whole region and we're welcoming to all students who are 14-20 years old.
